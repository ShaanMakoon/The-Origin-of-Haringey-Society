      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#6B8E23] mb-2">Happy Birthday Haringey</h2>

  <p>
    This society was founded, formed and established on the 1st of April 2025 - on the 60th anniversary of the creation and birth of the London Borough of Haringey.
  </p>
  It was on this date in 1965 that the London we know and recognise was formed. Haringey was a brand new borough never having existed before but its name perhaps one the oldest in the country. It has the most fascinating history - with many hidden secrets to be revealed.

  <p><br>
    To celebrate Haringey's 60th birthday and the founding of this society, I shall be preambulating and 'Beating the Bounds' of the western boundary of Haringey which borders Waltham Forest and runs along the River Lea from it's southern border with Hackney to it's northern border with Enfield at Chalk Bridge.
</p>
<br>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#6B8E23] mb-2">Beating the bounds</h2>
  <p>
  Beating the bounds is an ancient custom, practice and ritual to mark and establish the area of a parish or borough.
   It is performed by beating or thrashing the boundary with sticks and branches of, usually, willow. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>
    This custom goes back to at least the times of the Anglo-Saxons and King Alfred the Great, well over 1000 years ago, and perhaps to a festival celebrating the Roman god Terminus - the god of landmarks.
    <br> In King Alfred's time, the English were at war with the Vikings in England. They resolved this by agreeing to divide England into two countries. England : the land of the Anglo-Saxons and Danelaw : the land of the Vikings. Where was the boundary between England and Danelaw? Part of that boundary was the River Lea!  
  </p>
  <br>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#6B8E23] mb-2">Deep Past</h2>

  It says much of Haringey's deep past to realise that it's western border was not only the boundary with a different parish, a municipal, a borough, a 'hundred', a shire, a county but, in effect, a different country!
</p>
<p>
  So it's very fitting and historically poetic to 'beat the bounds' of this part of Haringey's boundary to celebrate and commemorate the birth of Haringey, London and this historical & geological society.
</p>
  <br>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#6B8E23] mb-2">Mysterious</h2>


  <p>
    The names Haringey, Hornsey, Crouch End and Tottenham are the most beguiling, mysterious and fascinating names. 
    <br>These names are so prosaic now, the passage of time has silenced the 'ring of truth' and profundity of them.
  </p>
<br>
  <p>Haringey has the most amazing history. 
  I have discovered its history goes back as far as the Mesolithic times - pre 3000 BCE!! </p>

  Oh Haringey, Oh Haringey,
  my constant, comforting companion.
  You have raised, bred and buttered me,
  you are my hero, you are my champion.
  
  Thank you for your time,
  I will give you some of mine.
  I so long & I so pine,
  to hear your faithful chime.
  
  We have seen it all,
  the bad times & when we've had a ball.
  To us, you have so much to impart & teach.
  To you, I implore & I beseech.
  That in good & before the nick of time,
  your glorious 'Ring of Truth' will chime...
