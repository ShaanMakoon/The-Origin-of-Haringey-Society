        A society for the history and geology of Haringey.

        Founded 1st April 2025
        <br>
        60 years after the creation and birth of the London Borough of Haringey.

      <p>
        It was on this date in 1965 that the London we know and recognise was formed. Haringey was a brand new borough never having existed before but its name perhaps one the oldest in the country. It has the most fascinating history - with many hidden secrets to be revealed.
        <br><br>
        To celebrate Haringey's 60th birthday and the founding of this society, I shall be preambulating and 'Beating the Bounds' of the western boundary of Haringey which borders Waltham Forest and runs along the River Lea from it's southern border with Hackney where Craven Park Road meets the river, to it's northern border with Enfield at Chalk Bridge.
        <br><br>
        Beating the bounds is an ancient custom, practice and ritual to mark and establish the area of a parish or borough. It is performed by beating or thrashing the boundary with sticks and branches of, usually, willow. 
        <br><br>
        This custom goes back to at least the times of the Anglo-Saxons and King Alfred the Great, well over 1000 years ago, and perhaps to a festival celebrating the Roman god Terminus - the god of landmarks. In King Alfred's time, the English were at war with the Vikings in England. They resolved this by agreeing to divide England into two countries. England : the land of the Anglo-Saxons and Danelaw : the land of the Vikings. Where was the boundary between England and Danelaw? Part of that boundary was the River Lea!
        <br><br>
        It says much of Haringey's deep past to realise that it's western border was not only the boundary with a different parish, a municipal, a district, a borough, a 'hundred', a shire, a county but a different country! So it's very fitting and historically poetic to 'beat the bounds' of this part of Haringey's boundary to celebrate and commemorate the birth of Haringey and this historical & geological society.
        <br><br>
        The name 'Haringey' is the most beguiling, mysterious and fascinating name - as are Hornsey, Crouch End and Tottenham. These names are so prosaic now it has silenced the 'ring of truth' and profundity of them.
        <br><br>
        Haringey has the most amazing history.

  Haringey, oh Haringey,
  my constant, comforting companion.
  You have raised, bred and buttered me,
  you are my hero, you are my champion.
  
  Thank you for your time,
  I will give you some of mine.
  I so long & I so pine,
  to hear your faithful chime.
  
  We have seen it all,
  the bad times & when we've had a ball.
  To us, you have so much to impart & teach.
  To you, I implore & I beseech.
  That in good & before the nick of time,
  your glorious 'Ring of Truth' will chime...
